          <b>Introduction to this Privacy Notice</b>
          The COVID Can I Do It team ("we", "us", "our") cares about your
          privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, disclose,
          and otherwise use ("Process") your information. This Information
          Collection Statement describes our practices in connection with the
          information we collect through this COVID Can I Do It Site and Service
          ("Service"). Please read the following to learn more about our privacy
          practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Definition of Personal Information For purposes of this Information
          Collection Statement, "Personal Information" means any information
          that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity,
          either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying
          information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          What We Collect and How We Use Information In providing you the
          content on this Service, we may collect information from you when you
          voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for activities and answers</li>
          <li>Submit a suggested activity to the Service</li>
          <li>Share additional details about yourself to the service</li>
          <li>Interact with the Service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We use that information solely for the purposes of responding to your
          request and improving the Service. For example, we may share your
          suggested activity with a network of individuals who will research the
          answer to the question. We may also post a version of your question
          and our answer that would be useful to provide to the public via the
          Service. We will not collect your name or email address. We take
          reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from loss,
          misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
          destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and
          managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information
          from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or
          destruction. Unfortunately, no security system is 100% secure; thus,
          we cannot ensure the security of all information you provide to us via
          our services. We work with partners to provide this service to you.
        </p>
        <p>Other information we may collect about you:</p>

            Cookies: Our services may use “cookies” and similar technologies
            (collectively, "Cookies"). Cookies are small text files that this
            website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and this
            information is stored in a file on your computer’s hard drive.
            Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your
            preferences so that we can use these to improve your next visit to
            our website.
            <ul>
              <li>
                One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the
                website. A cookie may save a user’s login details for example,
                so that the user does not need to login every time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cookies are also used for statistical purposes, to determine how
                the website is used.

            </ul>
          </li>

            Google Analytics: We may use Google Analytics to help us get a
            better understanding of how visitors use this website. The
            information generated by the Google Analytics cookie, about your use
            of this website, is transmitted to and stored by Google. If you do

            Other Non-Personal Information: In addition to any personal
            information or other information that you choose to provide to us on
            our services, we and our third-party service providers may use a
            variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that
            automatically collect certain website usage information whenever you
            visit or interact with our services. This information may include
            browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the
            source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar
            information. We may use this usage information for a variety of
            purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve our services. In
            addition, we may also collect your IP address or some other unique
            identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet,
            as applicable (collectively, referred to herein as a "Device
            Identifier"). A device identifier is a number that is automatically
            assigned to your device, and we may identify your device by its
            device identifier. When analyzed, usage information helps us
            determine how our services are used, such as what types of visitors
            arrive at the services, what type of content is most popular, what
            type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors
            are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We
            may associate your device identifier or website usage information
            with the personal information you provide, but we will treat the
            combined information as personal information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Visitors agree not to provide Sensitive Personal Information via this
          Service. Sensitive Personal Information includes any of the following:

          any successor directive or regulation). You should not provide
          information that you do not wish to be made public.
